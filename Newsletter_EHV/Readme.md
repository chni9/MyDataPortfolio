# Context
One of the initial projects I worked on at e-Health Venture was the development of a customized newsletter. The objective was to deliver emails to our partners, providing them with the latest trends and news in the digital health industry based on their specific preferences. 

# What I did
To accomplish this, I utilized web scraping techniques to collect relevant news articles from specialized digital health websites. I then developed an algorithm that matched the preferences of our partners with the available news articles in our database. Finally, I integrated Mailjet's API to automate the process of sending out the personalized newsletters on a weekly basis. 

# Results
By successfully completing this project, I not only gained experience in web scraping and API integration but also contributed to improving communication with our partners by providing them with tailored information in a timely manner. This project allowed me to enhance my technical skills and develop a deeper understanding of data-driven communication strategies within the digital health industry.

Our team was tasked with the goal of automating the process of data preparation for our client using the Java programming language and Spark tool. However, due to workspace limitations and team member familiarity, we were forced to switch to a Python environment. Despite this, we were able to successfully achieve our project objectives, which included data ingestion, fusion, cleaning, and delivery.

Our team worked to create a Python algorithm that could clean and fuse two datasets with the same primary key. The use of Spark was instrumental in managing large amounts of data efficiently, making it a vital tool in our project. Our primary objective was to create a streamlined process that would automate data preparation, thus reducing the manual workload and ensuring data accuracy.

Our experience taught us valuable lessons about project management and communication. We adopted an Agile methodology and established regular communication channels to ensure effective project management. Our team members were encouraged to provide regular updates on their progress and identify any risks or challenges they were facing. This allowed us to work together to resolve any issues and ensure the project stayed on track.

Throughout the project, we encountered both positive and negative deviations from our initial expectations. One significant positive deviation was increased efficiency due to the use of Spark. However, we also encountered unforeseen data challenges that required us to re-evaluate our approach and identify new solutions.

Our project deliverables included a closure report, video, visual, summary, and one-pager. These deliverables helped us to communicate the project's progress and results to the client. Additionally, they served as valuable documentation for future projects.

Constraints were an important consideration throughout the project. We had to balance cost, and time limitations while also ensuring that the project delivered the desired outcomes. We identified and managed project risks, such as data challenges and resource constraints, through various actions, such as regular communication and problem-solving sessions.

In conclusion, the project was successful in achieving its objectives, and we learned valuable lessons about effective project management and communication. We were able to deliver a streamlined data preparation process to our client that reduced manual workload and ensured data accuracy. Our experience highlights the importance of clear communication and effective project management when working on complex projects.

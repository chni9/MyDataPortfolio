# Gomoku AI Project

This project is my biggest AI related project at ESILV.

- Goal : using a MiniMax AI algortihm, I had to code and train an AI that would play Gomoku. Then, we had a competition where we would test our AIs against one another.
Our team reached quarter finals after beating a dozen other AIs. You can find more technical details in the file 'Project_report.docx' (in french).

- Language : Python
- Environment : Spyder

# Context
This project was one of my first during my internship at E-Health Venture, an incubator for startups in the digital health sector.
Addressing the challenge of acquiring new clients, particularly startups in the digital health sector, was a key focus at e-HealthVenture. The prospecting process was known to be time-consuming and demanding. 

# What I did
To alleviate this issue, my project aimed to automate the prospecting phase. It involved scraping data from multiple sources to identify new startups specializing in digital health. 
To achieve this, I utilized **Selenium and BeautifulSoup in Python** to scrape relevant information. Furthermore, I enriched the acquired data by scraping LinkedIn profiles, and then employed **ChatGPT's API** to filter and retain only the most interesting startups. 
Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to work independently, taking charge of the entire process from planning to execution. This level of autonomy empowered me to pursue my own ideas and drive the project forward. This experience was incredibly rewarding, allowing me to enhance both my project management and technical skills.

# Result
As a result of the project's success, I successfully added 300 new startups to our database. 
This significant expansion has proven invaluable to my colleagues in Sales, streamlining their prospecting efforts and enhancing the overall efficiency of the company.

# KNN AI Project

This is my second AI related project. It is a challenge where we had to test and implement a KNN algorithm.

- This challenge is separated in 3 steps :

1- We have a "data.txt" dataset, this dataset is about Iris. It has 10 input variables and 1 qualitative variable. For this step, we had to split the dataset into 'train' and 'test' datasets, then train and test our AI.

2- Then, we have a 'preTest.txt' dataset to freely test our algorithm.

3- Finally, we have a the 'finalTest.txt' and have to predict the class of each iris depending on the input parameters. Then, we had to submit our results and each team is ranked based on the accuracy of our results.
Our team had a 88% accuracy.
